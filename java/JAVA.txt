Day 1:

1.Latest Vesrion of JDK :JDK 22
 

2.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two methods. First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and the second method named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle:


public class Area {
    private double length;
    private double breadth;

    public void setDim(double length, double breadth) {
        this.length = length;
        this.breadth = breadth;
    }

    public double getArea() {
        return length * breadth;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
     
        Area rectangle = new Area();
        rectangle.setDim(5.0, 3.0);
        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + rectangle.getArea());
    }
}



Day 2:

public class Area {
    private double length;
    private double breadth;

    
    public Area(double length, double breadth) {
        this.length = length;
        this.breadth = breadth;
    }

    
    public void setDim(double length, double breadth) {
        this.length = length;
        this.breadth = breadth;
    }

    
    public double getArea() {
        return length * breadth;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Area rectangle = new Area(5.0, 3.0);
        System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is: " + rectangle.getArea());
    }
}
